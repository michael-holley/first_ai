This is my first AI project that I have done. This is following a tutorial on YouTube to work on understanding how to build a basic neural network.

The video I followed can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1PGJ9quPV8

NOTE: I keep getting an error saying that pandas is not a module. This is definitely not true. I am not an expert on this, as I said before this is just a learning project for me. 
I think I may be missing something important here and will be doing my due diligence to figure out a solution. Keep this in mind as you look over my code. The video link is above and you
can see if there is something I missed, but I can't find it there. 

This is a great starting point for me. Can't wait to learn more about this and find out how to build more complex networks.
